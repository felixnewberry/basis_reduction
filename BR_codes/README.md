# Basis Reduction

# Basis Reduction Code Commen to each numerical example
1. BR_FN.m - basis reduction
2. my_br_study.m - facilitates running BR_FN over range of N_hi high-fidelity samples and rank r 
3. my_pce - PC expansion 
4. br_bound_complete - full error analysis with comparison between MID and SMD 
5. br_bound_practical - practcal assessment of total error and probability 
6. coherence.m - calculates coherence 
7. mat_normalize.m - used in coherence
