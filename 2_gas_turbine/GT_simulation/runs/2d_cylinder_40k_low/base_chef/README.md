# Phasta Chef

In this folder we run phasta chef for each simulation so that boundary conditions can be rewritten in the simmodeler files. 

To setup the directory create sybmolic links to the appropriate files in 2_gas_turbine/GT_simulation/meshing/ i.e. 

link from GT_simulation/meshing the .smd, .sms and .x_t files to 'cylinder.smd', 'geom.sms' and 'geom.xmt_txt', respectively. 
Also create a link from 'geom.link' to 'geom.sms'.
